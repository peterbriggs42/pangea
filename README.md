### Running the solution



### Things I would have done with more time

NOTE: I tried to sprinkle in TODOs throughout the solution for specific places where I had plans for improvements I'd implement if given more time.
I'll outline some of the big themes in this section.

#### Behavior
The instructions only specify what should happen if the `country` query parameter maps to a valid country code, so that's all I've implemented here.
That said, I think it'd be more conventional REST design to have the endpoint return all Exchange Rates in the event that the user doesn't supply a 
country code via the HTTP request. I think it makes sense to return a 400 Bad Request in the event that the user *does* supply a country code that's invalid, though.

I didn't have time to implement this requirement 
>  Some partners will return multiple instances of the same exchange rate that were collected at different times, we only ever want to use the most recent exchange rate

Exception handling could be improved as well, I didn't go over the potential failure points with a fine-toothed comb but obvious places to handle 
failure could be the ingest -- if the partner rate file isn't found or is invalid we just let the file IO code throw whatever default exception and don't process it.

Although it's unlikely that a system designed in this fashion (where the ingest is baked into the same deployed service as the API) would be deployed to prod, if it were
I assume the ingest wouldn't be mission critical -- if we failed on one we could fall back to data generated by previous ingests. Given that assumption, it'd be 
preferable to just write the "file not found, unable to ingest" error to logs (and potentially also to alerting systems like Rollbar) and continue with API initialization.

#### Infrastructure
I would have liked to implement a Dockerfile to wrap the solution, since I'm developing on MacOS and am not sure if you guys are running Windows or Linux etc. 
That'd also make the steps to pull the solution and run it a bit easier since e.g. you wouldn't have to trust HTTPS certs, that'd be wrapped into the image.


#### Tests
I only had time to write rudimentary unit tests against one class -- ExchangeRateController. With further time I'd also like to test the ingest service,
